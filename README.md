- Actually scales properly instead of being huge
- Only gets smaller when it needs to (no more weird overlaps)
- Switches to vertical layout at 1600px width
- Doesn't cause horizontal scrolling anymore
- Made the responsive breakpoints actually make sense
- Text only centers on mobile
- Having trouble implementing the white glass social buttons, they're fine for now but not what I was picturing
- Bebas Neue for headings and Maven Pro for body text. "Glassy" looking stuff and bright, bold accents
- Should probably simplifiy to just black and white css files, instead of having aboutme.css 

- Unsure I like how the photo on about me scales
